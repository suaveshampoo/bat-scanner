# bat-scanner
Simulation of an inferior version of bat's echolocation.

6/21/2025

      This is a small learning project I decided to do. I started a month and a half ago, and I learned how to code in Python again. I learned a few things about circuits and hardware. Incorporating those two, I made a project that simulates a bat's echolocation scan. The goal is to build it for one purpose. It's not clean and it's definitely not perfect. It's much slower than a bat too. However, it does show the proximity of general things and I believe that is enough for determining your position in space. 
      
    I also briefly learned how to use Fusion360 to 3D-printing the cage while also remixing other 3D-prints for my other parts (ultrasonic sensor, servo, and gears). This project for sure could've been done within a little less than a month but I goofed around too much in the process and also just planning took a bit. I originally planned to scrap parts to make the things that were later 3D-printed. But that was too hard since nothing was really compatible with each other (the parts wouldn't fit nor stick :<). After careful consideration, I decided to invest in a Bambu Lab A1 for development of this project and for future endevours I may have. 
    
    Honestly, looking back at it, I'm pretty satisfied with what I learned. I learned how to code, model, and wire within a month a half. That's the most learning I've done outside of school within a few years. I wonder where this will take me.
